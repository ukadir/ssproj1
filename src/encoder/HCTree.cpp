 * of char with ASCII value i. Only non-zero frequency symbols should be used to
 * build the tree. The leaves vector must be updated so that it can be used in
 * encode() to improve performance.
 *
 * When building the HCTree, you should use the following tie-breaking rules to
 * match the output from reference solution in checkpoint:
 *
 *    1. HCNode with lower count should have higher priority. If count is the
 * same, then HCNode with a larger ascii value symbol should have higher
 * priority. (This should be already defined properly in the comparator in
 * HCNode.hpp)
 *    2. When popping two highest priority nodes from PQ, the higher priority
 * node will be the ‘c0’ child of the new parent HCNode.
 *    3. The symbol of any parent node should be taken from its 'c0' child.
